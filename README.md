# Practical Project
DevOps Core Practical Project

## Brief
This project is designed so that I can be creative, however, there are certain rules that need to be abide by. \
Basically, I am creating an application that generates "Objects" upon a set of predefined rules. These "Objects" can be from whatever domain I would like.

The requirements of the project are as follows:

* An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
This could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.
* An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
* If a change is made to a code base, then Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
* The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for.
* The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
* As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.
* The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.

The project needs to utilise the technologies discussed during the training modules:
* Kanban Board: Asana or an equivalent Kanban Board
* Version Control: Git
* CI Server: Jenkins
* Configuration Management: Ansible
* Cloud server: GCP virtual machines
* Containerisation: Docker
* Orchestration Tool: Docker Swarm
* Reverse Proxy: NGINX
